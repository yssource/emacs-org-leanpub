* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Publishing your words has never been easier than it is today. For a long time, getting a book published was a long and arduous process, in which you had to go through multiple gatekeepers to even have a chance to see your words on paper. Today, blogging means you can have your words read by thousands of people within minutes of writing them. Even publishing a book has become considerably easier through self publishing. There are many tools and publishers that allow you to get started for little or no money. Still, *getting started* can be confusing, and that is what this book is about.

In this book, I will show you the workflow and tools I use to publish [[https://leanpub.com/u/zzamboni][my books]]. This toolset is geared towards technical writing, which is what I do, but can just as well be used for any other style. The three main tools involved are:

- The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] editor together with  [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]  for writing, editing and exporting your text;
- [[https://github.com/][GitHub]] to store your book files.
- [[https://leanpub.com/][Leanpub]] for typesetting, previewing, publishing and selling your work.

The following are optional, but highly recommended for making the workflow more automated and consistent:

- [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]] (or other CI/CD tool) for automating the typesetting, previewing and publication process;
- [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]] (if you are using a Mac) for monitoring book builds.

To illustrate the process and provide you with a starting point, the source repository for this book is available at https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub. I am populating the repository live as I write this book, and you can follow the progress there and by getting the book for free at https://leanpub.com/emacs-org-leanpub. In the repository you can see all the "behind the scenes" text and configuration, and follow along as I describe them to you.

There are as many possible variations to this workflow as users out there. If you have any suggestions or tips that you think should be mentioned, please feel free to let me know! Send me a note or even better, submit a pull request at the book's GitHub repository. Let's make the book better together!

** The process

The high-level workflow for publishing a book using Emacs, org-mode and Leanpub looks like this:

#+begin_src dot :file "./images/high-level-workflow.png" :exports results
  digraph {
     rankdir=LR;
     files                [label="Source files\n(org file, figures, etc.)", fillcolor=green, style=filled, shape=oval];
     emacs                [label="Emacs + org-mode", fillcolor=green, style=filled, shape=box];
     manuscript           [label="Leanpub manuscript\n(Markua + other files)", fillcolor=yellow, style=filled, shape=box];
     leanpub              [label="Leanpub", fillcolor=blue, style=filled, shape=box];
     github               [label="GitHub", fillcolor=red, style=filled, shape=box];
     book                 [label="Book (PDF,\nePub, mobi, online)", shape=none];
     files -> emacs       [label="Edit"];
     emacs -> manuscript  [label="Export"];
     manuscript -> github [label="Commit"];
     github -> leanpub    [label="Typeset"];
     leanpub -> book      [label="Publish"];
     leanpub -> emacs     [label="Preview"];
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./images/high-level-workflow.png]]

In this setup, the only files you manipulates directly are your source files. For your text, you use Emacs with org-mode. In many cases, you can also generate figures from within Org mode, if they can be programmatically produced. Emacs exports your Org files into the structure and format required by Leanpub, and you commit the result to GitHub. From there, Leanpub picks up the files and produces a preview of your book, which you can review to make further changes. When you want to publish your work, you instruct Leanpub to do so, and Leanpub takes care of producing the end result and publishing it for the word to see.

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: manuscript/setting-up.markua
:END:

** Signing up for Leanpub

** Emacs and org-mode configuration

** Creating the book locally

#+begin_note
All the steps that follow show the actual commands and operations I performed while setting up the book you are reading! You can find the sources for the current version of this book at https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub.
#+end_note

The first step is to choose a short name or /slug/ for your book. This is the URL identifier for your book in Leanpub, and it should also be the name of your git repository (this is not mandatory, but makes the automation easier). This book's slug is =emacs-org-leanpub=, so its Leanpub URL will be leanpub.com/emacs-org-leanpub.

*** Creating a git repository for your book
Once we have a slug, we create a new Git repository for the new book. Leanpub supports both GitHub and Bickbucket repositories. In these descriptions I use GitHub, but similar steps apply if you are using Bitbucket.

#+begin_tip
I use the command-line utility [[https://hub.github.com/][hub]] to interact with GitHub from the command line. You can of course do the corresponding operations through the GitHub web interface if you so prefer. If you use Bitbucket, you can use [[https://seveas.github.io/git-spindle/bitbucket.html][git-spindle]] to interact with it from the command line as well.
#+end_tip

#+begin_src console
$ cd ~/Personal/writing
$ mkdir -p emacs-org-leanpub
$ cd emacs-org-leanpub
$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/taazadi1/Dropbox/Personal/writing/emacs-org-leanpub/.git/
#+end_src

Next, we create a new GitHub repository and connect it to our local repository:

#+begin_src console
$ cd ~/Personal/writing/emacs-org-leanpub
$ hub create
Updating origin
https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub.git (push)
#+end_src

*** Creating the book file

Now you can start writing your text inside the new repository. I usually write the main text in a file called =book.org= in the root directory of the repository.

To get you started, a basic skeleton for a book is the following:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+startup: indent
  ,#+tags: noexport sample frontmatter mainmatter backmatter
  ,#+options: toc:nil tags:nil

  ,#+title: Your book title
  ,#+author: Your name

  ,* Introduction

  Some text

  ,* Chapter 1

  Some more text
#+end_src

#+begin_tip
For a more complex example, you can find the sources for the current version of this book at https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub.
#+end_tip

Once you have some text, you can simply commit and push the changes to your remote repository:

#+begin_src console
$ cd ~/Personal/writing/emacs-org-leanpub
$ git add book.org
$ git ci -m "Initial commit of the book"
[master (root-commit) 3e166f4] Initial commit of the book

#+end_src

*** Your first book export
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: your-first-book-export
:END:

Now that you have the initial skeleton for your book, it's time to export it from Org to Leanpub's Markua format, from which Leanpub can produce a rendered version of your book for you to preview.

For this, we use the =ox-leanpub= module which you installed on Emacs. Pressing ~C-c C-e~ will show you Org-mode's Export screen. Among other options, you should see the following:

#+begin_example
[M] Export to Leanpub Markua
    [M] To temporary buffer       [m] To file
    [o] To file and open
    [b] Multifile: Whole book     [s] Multifile: Subset
    [c] Multifile: Current chapter
#+end_example

Press ~M b~ to export the whole book in "Multifile format", which exports your book from the Org file and creates the [[https://leanpub.com/manual/read#writing-your-book-in-github-mode][structure and files]] needed by Leanpub to render the book. For example, for this book, the following directories and symlinks will be created (the original source file is =book.org=, everything else is created from it):

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports results :wrap example
    tree --noreport -L 3 -I covers
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  .
  ├── book.org
  ├── images -> manuscript/resources/images
  └── manuscript
      ├── Book.txt
      ├── automation.markua
      ├── images -> resources/images
      ├── introduction.markua
      ├── resources
      │   └── images
      ├── setting-up.markua
      ├── the-workflow.markua
      └── tips-and-tricks.markua
  #+end_example

In short, this is what the export operation does:

- Creates a =manuscript= folder if needed, under which all other files are stored.
  - A =resources/images= directory is created inside =manuscript=, as required by the Leanpub Markua exporter.
  - Symlinks to the =images= directory are created both from the top-level directory, and from the =manuscript= directory, to allow referencing the same image files both from the Org file and from the exported Markua files.
- Exports one =.markua= file for each top-level header (chapter) in your book.
- Creates the =Book.txt= file with the filenames corresponding to the chapters of your book.
  - Depending on the exporter settings, the =Subset.txt= and =Sample.txt= files may also be created.

** Creating the book on Leanpub

Now that you have the basics of a book, you need to create a new book in Leanpub and link it to your Git repository. Assuming you are signed into your Leanpub account, you can do this by visiting https://leanpub.com/create/book, and following the prompts. In particular, note the following:

#+begin_warning
Leanpub's pricing plans changed in October 2019, making it necessary to have a "Standard" or "Pro" plan to be able to write your book using Git integrations.
#+end_warning

- The "On your computer" option under "Where do you want to write" is only available in the paid Leanpub plans. Choose the corresponding git option, and enter the path to your repository as created above.
- I suggest you use the same name for the "Book URL" and for your Git repository. This is not mandatory, but it makes some of the automation easier (particularly for integration with CI/CD systems).
- I personally like to enable "Send output to Dropbox" to always have the latest rendered version of my books synchronized to my machine, but feel free to leave it disabled if you prefer.

  [[file:images/leanpub-create-book.png]]

After you create the book, Leanpub shows you a "Getting Started" page which describes some additional steps you need to complete to finish setting up your book and its integration with your git repository.

[[file:images/leanpub-getting-started-screen.png]]

Make sure you follow these instructions, which include:

- Adding Leanpub as a collaborator to your GitHub or BitBucket repository. This makes it possible for Leanpub to read the files from your repository to render the book.
  [[file:images/github-add-collaborator.png]]
- Adding a webhook to your repository to trigger an automatic preview of your book whenever you push new changes to your repository. This is an optional step, but one which makes it much easier to generate the book whenever you make changes. Not this this "hardcodes" the type of book generation (Preview or Publish) which happens when you push changes. For a more complex setup, see [[#ci-cd-for-previewing-and-publishing][CI/CD for previewing and publishing]].
  [[file:images/github-add-webhook.png]]
  #+begin_warning
Leanpub's "Edit Webhook" page includes your real Leanpub API key, which you should keep secret, as it enables access to all operations on your book.
  #+end_warning

** Your first book preview

Once you have created your book on Leanpub and connected it to your Git repository, you are ready to produce your first preview. Follow the same steps shown in [[#your-first-book-export][Your first book export]] to generate the Markua files from your Org file, and then commit and push the changes to your repository.

#+begin_src console
$ cd ~/Personal/writing/emacs-org-leanpub
$ git add .
$ git ci -m 'Commit for first book Preview'
[master edc3c97] Commit for first book Preview
 7 files changed, 80 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 19, done.
Counting objects: 100% (19/19), done.
Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 1.32 MiB | 1.28 MiB/s, done.
To https://github.com/zzamboni/emacs-org-leanpub.git
   00a67a1..edc3c97  master -> master
#+end_src

If you configured the webhook in the previous steps, the =git push= will automatically trigger a book preview. If you did not, you can visit the Preview page of your book at =https://leanpub.com/<your-book-id>/preview= and clicking on the "Create Preview" button.  In any case, after a few minutes you will get an email from Leanpub telling you about the preview creation.

[[file:images/leanpub-preview-email.png]]

If you enabled Dropbox integration, the generated preview files of your book will be automatically added to your Dropbox folder, and you can also download them from the Preview page of your book.

*Congratulations!* You have executed the first end-to-end production of your book, and you can now hold in your hands (or in your PDF viewer, at least) the very first copy of your book. Read on to learn

** Additional book configuration

Leanpub offers you a great degree of control over all aspects of your books aspect and production. All of them are optional, so you can do them as you explore and feel more comfortable. I highly recommend that you explore your book's management menu in Leanpub.

[[file:images/leanpub-book-menu.png]]

Here are some of the common things that I like to configure:

- Visual settings :: Found in /Settings/ / /Book Theme/. You can choose one of the ready-made themes as chosen when you created the book (Business, Technical, Fiction) but I like to choose "Custom" and fine-tune the different parameters. You can customize the page size, fonts, line spacing, line numbering in code blocks, and many other things. I recommend you set at least the page size you want before creating a cover for your book, since it determines the size of the image you have to upload. But otherwise, feel free to experiment, preview your book with different settings and choose the look you like best.
- Cover :: Found in /Settings/ / /Upload Book Cover/. This is perhaps one of the most important visual aspects you'll want to configure to make sure your book stands out. You can upload an image to use as your book cover, although the page also notes that if you do not upload an image, you can also set the cover of your book by storing an image called =title_page.png= or =title_page.jpg= inside your =images= folder. The size of the image depends on the page size of your book.
- Title and subtitle :: Found in the /Book Info/ / /Book Details/ page. You can modify the title you specified during book creation, and optionally add a subtitle.
- Categories :: Found in /Book Info/ / /Categories/. Allows you to define certain categories for your book, to make them easier to find by readers.
